warning: Git tree '/home/oxce5/hydenix' is dirty
evaluation warning:
                    The aagl-gtk-on-nix release branch is 24.11, but the current
                    Nixpkgs release is 25.05. This mismatch may cause errors and
                    unexpected behavior. It is recommended to use a release of
                    aagl-gtk-on-nix that matches your Nixpkgs release.

                    If you insist on using this version, you can disable this warning by
                    setting

                    aagl.enableNixpkgsReleaseBranchCheck = false;

                    in your configuration.
